The SFG flexible gripper is an innovative flexible device that mimics starfish style and human hand gripping. It achieves bending deformation through inflation, adaptively wrapping the target object to complete gripping actions and reverse deformation through deflation to complete placement or pre-gripping actions. It has the characteristics of good compatibility, multiple categories, and gentle movements, making it suitable for gripping the most irregular and vulnerable objects.

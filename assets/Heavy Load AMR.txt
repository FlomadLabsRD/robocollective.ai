<h1 data-start="674" data-end="746">RoboCo Heavy Load AMR – Smart, High-Capacity Autonomous Mobile Robot</h1>
<p data-start="748" data-end="1119">The <strong data-start="752" data-end="777">RoboCo Heavy Load AMR</strong> is a next-generation <strong data-start="799" data-end="826">autonomous mobile robot</strong> designed to carry payloads of up to <strong data-start="863" data-end="873">600 kg</strong>. Built for factories, warehouses, and logistics, it combines strength, precision, and adaptability. As a result, it has become the preferred solution for businesses looking to reduce labor costs and improve efficiency with reliable automation.</p>

<h2 data-start="1121" data-end="1156">High Payload and Smart Lifting</h2>
<p data-start="1157" data-end="1518">Thanks to its advanced lifting system, the Heavy Load AMR can identify shelves, transport goods, and place items with precision. This automation reduces manual effort, lowers operational risks, and boosts productivity. Moreover, with a <strong data-start="1393" data-end="1429">rapid charging time of 1.1 hours</strong> and an <strong data-start="1437" data-end="1465">8-hour battery endurance</strong>, it supports continuous operations without delays.</p>

<h2 data-start="1520" data-end="1560">Seamless Integration and Scheduling</h2>
<p data-start="1561" data-end="1860">The AMR integrates smoothly with <strong data-start="1594" data-end="1625">MES, ERP, and WMS platforms</strong>, allowing real-time task assignment. In addition, its <strong data-start="1680" data-end="1712">multi-robot scheduling (RCS)</strong> ensures multiple robots can coordinate effectively in large-scale facilities. Therefore, scaling up operations becomes simple and cost-effective.</p>

<h2 data-start="1862" data-end="1893">Built for Global Standards</h2>
<p data-start="1894" data-end="2303">Certified under <strong data-start="1910" data-end="1939">CE, FCC, KC, NCC, and EMC</strong>, the RoboCo Heavy Load AMR meets the highest safety and quality standards. It also supports <strong data-start="2032" data-end="2057">4G/Wi-Fi connectivity</strong>, enabling easy integration with IoT devices, barcode scanners, call buttons, elevators, and cloud-based monitoring. Furthermore, its expandable peripherals—such as notification lights, follow bracelets, and rollers—allow maximum customization.</p>

<h2 data-start="2305" data-end="2326">Proven Worldwide</h2>
<p data-start="2327" data-end="2715">Already deployed in <strong data-start="2347" data-end="2364">50+ countries</strong> and trusted by over <strong data-start="2385" data-end="2406">1,500 enterprises</strong>, RoboCo robots deliver measurable results. Businesses worldwide rely on the Heavy Load AMR to cut costs, increase productivity, and future-proof their automation strategies. With its <strong data-start="2590" data-end="2658">high lifting capacity, advanced navigation, and rapid deployment</strong>, it is the ultimate choice for modern smart factories.</p>

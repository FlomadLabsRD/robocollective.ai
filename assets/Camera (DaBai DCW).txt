<p data-start="329" data-end="756">The <strong data-start="333" data-end="346">DaBai DCW</strong> is a professional-grade binocular structured light camera engineered to deliver <strong data-start="427" data-end="462">high-precision depth perception</strong> and <strong data-start="467" data-end="492">low-power performance</strong> for robotics, automation, and AI applications. Powered by <strong data-start="551" data-end="580">self-developed ASIC chips</strong>, this camera ensures lower computing power requirements while providing <strong data-start="653" data-end="723">high resolution, fast frame rates, and reliable obstacle detection</strong> across a wide field of vision.</p>
<p data-start="758" data-end="1270">With a <strong data-start="765" data-end="803">working distance of 0.2 m to 2.5 m</strong>, the DaBai DCW is ideal for close-to-mid-range applications, such as indoor navigation, robotic grasping, and obstacle avoidance. Its <strong data-start="940" data-end="980">depth FOV of H79° × V62° × D91° ± 3°</strong> ensures a wide capture angle, while the <strong data-start="1021" data-end="1071">infrared FOV (16:9, H86° × V55° × D93.5° ± 3°)</strong> enhances depth accuracy in varying light conditions. The <strong data-start="1129" data-end="1163">color FOV of H64° × V55° (4:3)</strong> provides clear, colorful imaging, making it suitable for vision-guided robotics and AI perception tasks.</p>
<p data-start="1272" data-end="1628">The DaBai DCW supports a <strong data-start="1297" data-end="1350">depth resolution of up to 1920 × 1080 at 5/10 fps</strong>, ensuring smooth data capture, and maintains <strong data-start="1396" data-end="1456">relative accuracy of 1.0% at 1000 mm and 1.1% at 2000 mm</strong>. Despite its robust capabilities, it remains compact and lightweight at <strong data-start="1529" data-end="1557">89.82 × 25.10 × 25.10 mm</strong>, powered via a simple <strong data-start="1580" data-end="1604">5V USB 2.0 interface</strong> for easy integration.</p>
<p data-start="1630" data-end="1935">Designed for <strong data-start="1643" data-end="1703">robotics, navigation systems, and intelligent automation</strong>, the DaBai DCW strikes a balance between <strong data-start="1728" data-end="1772">performance, efficiency, and portability</strong>. With average power consumption under <strong data-start="1811" data-end="1820">1.2 W</strong>, it’s the perfect solution for developers and researchers needing reliable 3D vision in compact robotic systems.</p>

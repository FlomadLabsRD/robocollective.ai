<p data-start="938" data-end="1328">The <strong data-start="942" data-end="966">ECO65-6F robotic arm</strong> is a <strong data-start="972" data-end="1025">six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) automation solution</strong> developed by RealMan. Designed for <strong data-start="1061" data-end="1099">industrial production and research</strong>, it combines <strong data-start="1113" data-end="1187">high payload capacity, precision performance, and long-term durability</strong>. With its <strong data-start="1198" data-end="1228">integrated control cabinet</strong> and lightweight body, the ECO65-6F is easy to deploy across a wide range of automation scenarios.</p>

<h3 data-start="1330" data-end="1368">ECO65-6F Robotic Arm Performance</h3>
<p data-start="1369" data-end="1756">This arm delivers an <strong data-start="1390" data-end="1419">effective payload of 5 kg</strong> and a <strong data-start="1426" data-end="1453">peak load of up to 9 kg</strong>, supported by a <strong data-start="1470" data-end="1500">working radius of 638.5 mm</strong>. It achieves a <strong data-start="1516" data-end="1559">repeat positioning accuracy of ±0.05 mm</strong>, ensuring consistent handling in logistics, assembly, and electronics manufacturing. Despite its strength, the ECO65-6F remains manageable at only <strong data-start="1707" data-end="1717">7.9 kg</strong>, making integration straightforward.</p>

<h3 data-start="1758" data-end="1794">Motion Control and Versatility</h3>
<p data-start="1795" data-end="2133">The ECO65-6F robotic arm offers a <strong data-start="1829" data-end="1860">joint motion range of ±178°</strong> and a <strong data-start="1867" data-end="1890">360° rotation on J6</strong>. With <strong data-start="1897" data-end="1931">joint speeds of 180°/s (J1–J2)</strong> and <strong data-start="1936" data-end="1954">225°/s (J3–J6)</strong>, it balances speed and accuracy. In addition, its <strong data-start="2005" data-end="2046">six-axis force control (200 N / 7 Nm)</strong> and <strong data-start="2051" data-end="2078">&lt;0.1% FS force accuracy</strong> make it reliable for delicate, high-precision tasks.</p>

<h3 data-start="2135" data-end="2168">Efficiency and Connectivity</h3>
<p data-start="2169" data-end="2497">Powered by a <strong data-start="2182" data-end="2202">DC 20–30V system</strong> with only <strong data-start="2213" data-end="2234">200 W consumption</strong>, the ECO65-6F ensures energy efficiency. Its <strong data-start="2280" data-end="2320">IP54-rated aluminum alloy + ABS body</strong> guarantees durability. The arm supports <strong data-start="2361" data-end="2417">Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RS485, USB, and network interfaces</strong>, plus <strong data-start="2424" data-end="2494">drag-and-drop teaching, pendant control, API, and JSON integration</strong>.</p>

<h3 data-start="2499" data-end="2532">Built for Industrial Growth</h3>
<p data-start="2533" data-end="2840">Tested for a <strong data-start="2546" data-end="2588">service life of more than 30,000 hours</strong>, the ECO65-6F robotic arm is the <strong data-start="2622" data-end="2701">ideal choice for automation in logistics, 3C electronics, and manufacturing</strong>. It delivers <strong data-start="2715" data-end="2770">cost-effectiveness, high precision, and reliability</strong>—helping businesses scale productivity without sacrificing accuracy.</p>

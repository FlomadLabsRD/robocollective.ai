<p data-start="291" data-end="792">Upgrade your robotics and automation projects with the <strong data-start="346" data-end="368">RM-MVQ (DaBai DCW)</strong> binocular structured light camera, engineered for performance, efficiency, and reliability. Unlike standard depth cameras, the RM-MVQ uses <strong data-start="508" data-end="537">self-developed ASIC chips</strong> to deliver exceptional computing efficiency with <strong data-start="587" data-end="615">lower power requirements,</strong> consuming less than <strong data-start="638" data-end="647">1.2 W</strong> on average. This means you get more processing power without draining energy, making it ideal for mobile robots, drones, and embedded systems.</p>
<p data-start="794" data-end="1213">With a <strong data-start="801" data-end="847">6-million-pixel CMOS roller shutter sensor</strong> and a maximum resolution of <strong data-start="876" data-end="891">3072 × 2048</strong>, the RM-MVQ provides <strong data-start="913" data-end="954">crystal-clear depth and color imaging</strong>. Its <strong data-start="960" data-end="991">high frame rate of 19.1 fps</strong> ensures smooth performance, while the wide <strong data-start="1035" data-end="1052">field of view</strong> enables accurate perception, obstacle avoidance, and navigation in complex environments. Robots can “see” more, react faster, and operate with greater safety.</p>
<p data-start="1215" data-end="1477">Despite its advanced capabilities, the RM-MVQ remains <strong data-start="1269" data-end="1296">compact and lightweight</strong> at just <strong data-start="1305" data-end="1324">29 × 29 × 42 mm</strong> and approximately <strong data-start="1343" data-end="1352">100 g</strong>. Installation is simple, and the <strong data-start="1386" data-end="1404">GigE interface</strong> provides fast, reliable data transmission for industrial applications.</p>
<p data-start="1479" data-end="1769">Whether you are developing <strong data-start="1506" data-end="1588">autonomous robots, AI-driven navigation systems, or precision automation tools</strong>, the RM-MVQ is designed to deliver professional-grade results. Compact, powerful, and efficient — this camera is the perfect choice for innovators in robotics and machine vision.</p>

<p data-start="245" data-end="662">The <strong data-start="249" data-end="258">D435C</strong> is a high-performance 3D camera that combines <strong data-start="305" data-end="373">depth sensing, RGB color imaging, and VCSEL projector technology</strong> to deliver accurate perception even in challenging environments. Built with a <strong data-start="452" data-end="477">global shutter sensor</strong> and a <strong data-start="484" data-end="498">large lens</strong>, it ensures crisp, distortion-free images with excellent <strong data-start="556" data-end="581">low-light performance</strong>, making it an ideal solution for robotics, AI, AR/VR, and automation projects.</p>
<p data-start="664" data-end="1127">With a <strong data-start="671" data-end="708">working distance of 0.2 m to 10 m</strong>, the D435C is versatile enough for both close-range interactions and extended-range detection. It provides a <strong data-start="818" data-end="862">depth resolution of 1280 × 720 at 90 fps</strong> for smooth and detailed depth mapping, and a <strong data-start="908" data-end="953">color resolution of 1920 × 1080 at 30 fps</strong> for high-quality RGB video. Its wide <strong data-start="991" data-end="1023">depth FOV of 87° × 58° × 95°</strong> and <strong data-start="1028" data-end="1064">color FOV of 69.4° × 42.5° × 77°</strong> ensure a broad field of vision for capturing dynamic scenes.</p>
<p data-start="1129" data-end="1438">Engineered for accuracy, the D435C maintains a <strong data-start="1176" data-end="1216">relative error of only 2% at 2000 mm</strong>, ensuring reliable 3D measurement and object detection. Despite its advanced capabilities, the camera remains compact at <strong data-start="1338" data-end="1357">90 × 25 × 25 mm</strong> and integrates seamlessly via <strong data-start="1388" data-end="1399">USB 3.0</strong> with a standard <strong data-start="1416" data-end="1435">5V power supply</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="1440" data-end="1646">Whether you are building <strong data-start="1465" data-end="1540">autonomous robots, interactive AI systems, or computer vision solutions</strong>, the D435C provides the <strong data-start="1565" data-end="1602">precision, speed, and reliability</strong> needed to bring your innovations to life.</p>

<h3 data-start="528" data-end="612">RGI-100-30 Infinite-Rotation Electric Gripper – Compact, Precise, and Powerful</h3>
<p data-start="614" data-end="941">The <strong data-start="618" data-end="632">RGI-100-30</strong> from DH Robotics is the <strong data-start="657" data-end="716">first self-developed infinite-rotation electric gripper</strong>, setting a new benchmark in robotic gripping technology. Despite its compact body of just <strong data-start="807" data-end="829">158 × 75.5 × 47 mm</strong>, it integrates <strong data-start="845" data-end="867">dual servo systems</strong> for exceptional flexibility and performance in automation and robotics.</p>
<p data-start="943" data-end="1349">With a <strong data-start="950" data-end="989">clamping force of 30–100 N per side</strong> and a <strong data-start="996" data-end="1023">travel range of 0–30 mm</strong>, this gripper can handle both delicate and moderately heavy objects. It provides a <strong data-start="1107" data-end="1133">peak torque of 1.5 N·m</strong> and a <strong data-start="1140" data-end="1167">rated torque of 0.5 N·m</strong>, ensuring stability even under demanding tasks. Most importantly, its <strong data-start="1238" data-end="1270">infinite rotation capability</strong> eliminates cable-winding issues, allowing seamless and continuous operation.</p>
<p data-start="1351" data-end="1712">Built for <strong data-start="1361" data-end="1384">precision and speed</strong>, the RGI-100-30 achieves a <strong data-start="1412" data-end="1448">rotation repeatability of ±0.05°</strong> and a <strong data-start="1455" data-end="1493">position repeatability of ±0.02 mm</strong>. It also delivers a <strong data-start="1514" data-end="1551">maximum rotation speed of 2160°/s</strong> with <strong data-start="1557" data-end="1602">opening and closing times as fast as 0.7s</strong>. As a result, it is highly effective in high-throughput environments where speed and accuracy are critical.</p>
<p data-start="1714" data-end="1985">Weighing just <strong data-start="1728" data-end="1738">1.5 kg</strong>, the gripper is lightweight yet powerful. It runs on a <strong data-start="1794" data-end="1820">24V DC supply at 1.0 A</strong> and supports <strong data-start="1834" data-end="1856">RS485 (MODBUS RTU)</strong> and <strong data-start="1861" data-end="1876">Digital I/O</strong> communication. With an <strong data-start="1900" data-end="1926">IP40 protection rating</strong>, it is well-suited for standard industrial applications.</p>
<p data-start="1987" data-end="2311">The RGI-100-30 is an excellent choice for <strong data-start="2029" data-end="2110">precision assembly, electronics manufacturing, and advanced robotics research</strong>. With its ability to <strong data-start="2132" data-end="2166">grip and rotate simultaneously</strong>, it delivers unmatched <strong data-start="2190" data-end="2231">flexibility, reliability, and control</strong>, making it a trusted solution for automation and innovative handling systems.</p>

<p data-start="527" data-end="908">The <strong data-start="531" data-end="542">ECO65-B</strong> is a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) <strong data-start="578" data-end="604">economical robotic arm</strong> from RealMan. It is designed for companies and research labs that need a balance of <strong data-start="689" data-end="731">precision, strength, and affordability</strong>. Built with an <strong data-start="747" data-end="772">integrated controller</strong> and durable housing, the ECO65-B is well-suited for <strong data-start="825" data-end="905">logistics, 3C electronics, industrial production, and specialized automation</strong>.</p>

<h3 data-start="910" data-end="934">Compact and Strong</h3>
<p data-start="935" data-end="1384">Despite its compact size, the ECO65-B delivers impressive performance. It supports a <strong data-start="1020" data-end="1054">payload capacity of up to 5 kg</strong> and a <strong data-start="1061" data-end="1089">working radius of 610 mm</strong>. With a <strong data-start="1098" data-end="1141">repeat positioning accuracy of ±0.05 mm</strong>, it ensures consistent results in demanding environments. Weighing only <strong data-start="1214" data-end="1224">7.8 kg</strong>, it is easy to install and integrate into different setups. The <strong data-start="1289" data-end="1311">IP54-rated housing</strong> adds protection against dust and splashes, extending its service life.</p>

<h3 data-start="1386" data-end="1414">Efficient and Reliable</h3>
<p data-start="1415" data-end="1653">Powered by <strong data-start="1426" data-end="1439">DC 20–30V</strong>, the ECO65-B consumes only <strong data-start="1467" data-end="1476">200 W</strong>, making it an energy-efficient choice. Safety features include <strong data-start="1540" data-end="1565">hard brakes for J1–J2</strong> and <strong data-start="1570" data-end="1595">soft brake protection</strong> for other joints, ensuring smooth and secure operation.</p>

<h3 data-start="1655" data-end="1694">Flexible Control and Connectivity</h3>
<p data-start="1695" data-end="1957">The robotic arm supports <strong data-start="1720" data-end="1776">Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB, RS485, and network interfaces</strong>. Programming is simplified through <strong data-start="1812" data-end="1896">drag-and-drop teaching, pendant control, API integration, and JSON compatibility</strong>. This makes deployment fast, adaptable, and user-friendly.</p>

<h3 data-start="1959" data-end="1983">A Smart Investment</h3>
<p data-start="1984" data-end="2235">With <strong data-start="1989" data-end="2018">joint speeds up to 225°/s</strong> and a <strong data-start="2025" data-end="2050">motion range of ±178°</strong>, the ECO65-B combines speed with accuracy. It offers an <strong data-start="2107" data-end="2159">affordable, high-performance automation solution</strong> for organizations seeking to expand capabilities while controlling costs.</p>

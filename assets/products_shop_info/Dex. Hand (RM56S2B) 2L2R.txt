This five-finger dexterous hand, also known as the piano hand, moves quickly and has a slightly smaller grip. It has an integrated force sensor, 6 degrees of freedom, 12 motion joints and supports ROS. It can simulate complex movements like playing the piano and guessing boxing by combining it with a force-position hybrid control algorithm.

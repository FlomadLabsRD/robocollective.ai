<h3 data-start="416" data-end="494">EVSo8 Electric Vacuum Effector – Compact, Reliable, and Energy-Efficient</h3>
<p data-start="496" data-end="1007">The <strong data-start="500" data-end="534">EVSo8 Electric Vacuum Effector</strong> is part of the EVS series, designed for modern automation. It provides a <strong data-start="608" data-end="674">simple, cost-effective, and highly efficient gripping solution</strong> for robotics. Unlike traditional pneumatic systems, the EVSo8 does not require external air supply systems. This eliminates extra equipment and lowers both operating and maintenance costs. Its compact design, quick installation, and programmable control make it ideal for logistics, electronics, assembly, and smart manufacturing.</p>
<p data-start="1009" data-end="1441">The EVSo8 achieves a <strong data-start="1030" data-end="1057">vacuum degree of 5%–75%</strong> with an <strong data-start="1066" data-end="1094">airflow rate of 10 L/min</strong>. It can handle a <strong data-start="1112" data-end="1136">maximum load of 4 kg</strong> while weighing only <strong data-start="1157" data-end="1167">1.4 kg</strong>. This lightweight build makes it easy to integrate with a wide range of robotic arms. The unit also includes advanced features such as <strong data-start="1303" data-end="1376">power-off pressure maintenance, drop detection, and gripping feedback</strong>, which improve safety and reliability in dynamic environments.</p>
<p data-start="1443" data-end="1797">For industrial performance, the EVSo8 runs on a <strong data-start="1491" data-end="1515">24V DC supply (±10%)</strong> with a <strong data-start="1523" data-end="1551">rated current of just 1A</strong>. It communicates through <strong data-start="1577" data-end="1599">RS-485 (MODBUS RTU)</strong> or <strong data-start="1603" data-end="1618">Digital I/O</strong> for seamless integration. With its <strong data-start="1654" data-end="1679">IP54 protection level</strong>, it resists dust and splashes. The effector also delivers speed, with a <strong data-start="1752" data-end="1794">suction/release time of only 0.4s/0.2s</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="1799" data-end="1982">Whether for <strong data-start="1811" data-end="1887">pick-and-place operations, precision handling, or robotic gripping tasks</strong>, the EVSo8 delivers <strong data-start="1908" data-end="1955">efficiency, safety, and intelligent control</strong> in one compact solution.</p>

<p data-start="771" data-end="1084">The <strong data-start="775" data-end="798">ECO62-B robotic arm</strong> is a <strong data-start="804" data-end="868">compact yet powerful 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) manipulator</strong>, built for collaborative, safe, and efficient automation. Combining <strong data-start="937" data-end="977">strength, precision, and portability</strong>, it is ideal for <strong data-start="995" data-end="1081">industrial production, medical research, educational labs, and commercial services</strong>.</p>

<h4 data-start="1086" data-end="1129">Lightweight and Reliable Performance</h4>
<p data-start="1130" data-end="1408">Weighing only <strong data-start="1144" data-end="1154">3.3 kg</strong>, the ECO62-B supports a <strong data-start="1179" data-end="1204">payload of up to 2 kg</strong> with a <strong data-start="1212" data-end="1240">working radius of 355 mm</strong> and an <strong data-start="1248" data-end="1276">overall height of 505 mm</strong>. Its <strong data-start="1282" data-end="1311">repeatability of ±0.05 mm</strong> ensures precise, consistent results in delicate handling, assembly, and research applications.</p>

<h4 data-start="1410" data-end="1444">Efficient Power and Control</h4>
<p data-start="1445" data-end="1834">The arm runs on a <strong data-start="1463" data-end="1483">DC 20–30V system</strong> with a <strong data-start="1491" data-end="1525">low power consumption of 200 W</strong>, making it energy efficient. An <strong data-start="1558" data-end="1583">integrated controller</strong> simplifies setup and operation, while connectivity options include <strong data-start="1651" data-end="1707">Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RS485, USB, and network interfaces</strong>. Users can program and control with ease using <strong data-start="1755" data-end="1831">drag-and-drop teaching, pendant control, API, and JSON-based integration</strong>.</p>

<h4 data-start="1836" data-end="1866">Durable and Safe Design</h4>
<p data-start="1867" data-end="2184">Built with an <strong data-start="1881" data-end="1921">IP54-rated aluminum alloy + ABS body</strong>, the ECO62-B is protected against dust and light splashes. Safety features include <strong data-start="2005" data-end="2034">hard brake locks on J1–J3</strong> and <strong data-start="2039" data-end="2063">soft brakes on J4–J6</strong>, ensuring reliable long-term operation. With a <strong data-start="2111" data-end="2154">certified service life of 30,000+ hours</strong>, it provides lasting value.</p>

<h4 data-start="2186" data-end="2217">Compact Robotic Solution</h4>
<p data-start="2218" data-end="2452">The <strong data-start="2222" data-end="2245">ECO62-B robotic arm</strong> delivers an <strong data-start="2258" data-end="2315">affordable, precise, and flexible automation solution</strong> for <strong data-start="2320" data-end="2373">labs, classrooms, and industrial automation lines</strong>, helping organizations expand their automation capabilities with confidence.</p>
